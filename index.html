            <br>
            My name is Danny Yuhui Pang, and I am standing as a University-wide Postgraduate 
            Taught (PGT) Representative candidate for this election. As your University-wide PGT Representative, I will be representing 
            all PGT students, collating your feedback and make sure that they are heard and addressed by EUSA and the University. 
            <br>
            During my time as the University-wide PGT Rep, here are 3 preliminary examples of my aims:
            <ol>
              <li>Enhanced pre-arrival support</li>
              <li>Extended social and peer-support opportunities for PGT students</li>
              <li>Elevated career and future direction support</li>
            </ol>

        Hello all, <br>
<br>
I am Danny Pang, a current MSc Bioinformatics student looking to stand as your University-wide Postgraduate Taught Representative for the 2023/24 academic session. Without a doubt, your Postgraduate Taught (PGT) journey can be one of the most nerve-wracking transition periods in your entire life. To make it just a little less overwhelming, as your PGT Representative, I will work closely with you, your School/Programme-specific PGT representatives and EUSA to ensure that your voices will be heard and any issues addressed for positive changes. 
<br>
<br>
As I previously worked as a Programme Representative during my BSc Biological Sciences study here and stood on student society committee roles, I have developed sufficient organisational, interpersonal and communication skills to excel in this University-wide representative role. More importantly, I will be able to draw on my previous experience as a Programme Rep to support all Programme/School PGT representatives to excel in their roles to best represent all PGT students’ voices.
<br>
<br>
In my tenure, here are some preliminary examples of positive changes I hope to implement into the PGT experience:
<br>
<br>
1.	Enhanced pre-arrival support:
Programmes at the PGT level kick off in a much more fast-paced manner compared to an Undergraduate Programme, therefore any support offered pre-arrival and during the induction programme will be key to kickstarting your PGT programme smoothly. With your feedback, I hope to engage each School/Deanery to tailor their Welcome Week programme to best accommodate new entrants, continuing students and distant learners at the University and make sure that students are aware of essential registration steps and where to look for support. Last but not least, I would aim to push for housing support for continuing University students not qualified for University accommodations.
<br>
<br>
2.	Extended social and peer-support opportunities for PGT students:
Many student societies halt their activities at the end of Semester 2, leaving few and limited opportunities for PGT students during their summer dissertation periods. Similarly, many peer-assisted learning support (PALS) schemes have not included PGT students to a large extent. Therefore, I hope to encourage societies and PALS groups to include PG students in their committees to represent PG student voices and extend any social/academic opportunities into the summer for PGT students. Apart from societies/student groups, I would also like to encourage Schools/Deaneries to hold regular informal PGT student mixers and drop-in sessions to further promote social engagement.
<br>
<br>
3.	Elevated career and future direction support:
The intensity of a PGT programme is always accompanied by the imminent decision-making on what to do for the rest of your life. To make it as stress-free as possible for you, I will work closely with EUSA, Careers Service, IAD and other organisations to make support for applications, interviews, networking, transferable skill development, entrepreneurial development, visa-related enquiries and others easily accessible to you.
<br>
<br>
As it is still fairly early into our degree programmes, I am more than willing to hear from all PGT students regarding your experiences and opinions on your PGT journey so far, including but not limited to your school/deanery’s induction programme during Welcome Week, courses and assessments, social/non-academic experiences, as well as what you would like to see being improved on. 
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your attention, bye :)<br>
Danny Pang<br>
