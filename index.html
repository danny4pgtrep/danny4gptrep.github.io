            <br>
            My name is Danny Yuhui Pang, and I am standing as the University-wide Postgraduate 
            Taught (PGT) Representative in this election. As your University-wide PGT Representative, I will be representing 
            all PGT students, collating your feedback and make sure that they are heard and answered by EUSA and the University.
